# GPT2GPT

A Golang implementation of a simple ChatGPT API request written by ChatGPT (and fixed by a human) to be used from the CLI.

## Can I use this code?

You can. You are limited to 96 characters for your query. I have not bothered optimizing anything, I didn't even allow flags or os variables for the API key, meaning I have not built it to be released inside this repo. But you can do whatever you want. (And you can't 'talk' with it. It won't remember your previous query like the web version. But it does use the same model.)

It's not my code anyway. Or is it? :)

## Disclaimer

I did the absolute bare minimum whatsoever to make this work. I barely read the API documentation and I tried fixing everything using ChatGPT itself. The only thing I had to think about was how it messed up the Golang code. That's it.
